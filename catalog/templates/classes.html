												<h2>Small Engine Repair Classes</h2>
												<p>Learn how to make money fixing lawn mowers</p>
											</header>

                                            <p>My name is Casey Christensen. I have years of experience tuning up
                                            lawnmowers and running my own lawnmower tune up /repair business. I have
                                            also taught many classes including small engine repair classes for several years.</p>

											<h3>About the Class</h3>
											<p>
                                            It will be taught in 2 three-hour sessions (or one long day if we have to). Dates will be determined when we have interested parties. We are looking for mature teens who can sit through and stay engaged in the class.</p>

                                            <p>This class will teach students all about small engines. We'll concentrate
                                            mainly on the systems operating within a lawnmower - taught all with
                                            hands-on work with actual machines. Students will understand how small
                                            engines work by taking apart an engine and putting it back together. They
                                            will also learn how to tune up lawnmowers by properly installing spark
                                            plugs, checking and cleaning air filters, changing the oil, cleaning out the
                                            carburetor. Simple repairs such as repairing pull cables and springs will
                                            be taught as well.</p>

                                            <p>I'll also give practical business advice on how to run your own lawnmower
                                            repair/tune up business. You can make enough to earn your tuition money back and more in one day!
                                            Learn how when you take the class. Some students who took my class
                                            in the past have started their own businesses!</p>

                                            <p>Tuition: $125 per student.</p>
